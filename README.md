# grep
Grep emulator for powershell

## Abstract
There is a very usefull tool on linux based system called grep and I do miss it very much while working on windows based computers. 
Yestarday I wrote "Grep emulator for powershell". It's attempt to retain functionality of original with functionality and interface. Even though I did change layout of help screen a little bit, I tried to keep all original flags intact. 
I needed this tool to parse code for another my project, so some of flags will be added in future. 

## Usage
1. `git pull`
2. copy to any folder that is in PATH
3. run grep for help screen and enjoy :)

## Special thanks
Special thanks to creators of original grep application.
